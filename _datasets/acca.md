This repository contains the code and the experimental results related to the paper <b>Automating the correctness assessment of AI-generated code for security contexts</b>.

The paper presents ACCA, a fully automated method to evaluate the correctness of AI-generated code for security purposes. The method uses symbolic execution to assess whether the AI-generated code behaves as a reference implementation, demonstrating a very strong correlation with human-based evaluation, which is considered the ground truth for the assessment in the field.
