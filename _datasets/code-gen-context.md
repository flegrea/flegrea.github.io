This repository contains the code, the dataset and the experimental results related to the paper <b>Reading between the Lines: Context-Aware AI-based generation of software exploits</b>.

The paper analyzes state-of-the-art deep learning models for generating exploit code, including fine-tuned models and instruction-tuned LLMs, under varying contextual information conditions, in order to assess their ability to handle ambiguity, leverage useful context, and filter irrelevant information.
