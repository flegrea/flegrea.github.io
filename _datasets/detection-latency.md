This repository contains the code the paper: <b>Detection Latencies of Anomaly Detectors: An Overlooked Perspective?</b>

The repository contains two public datasets: ROSPaCe, and Arancino. The first is a dataset for intrusion detection composed by monitoring an embedded system on normal behavior and under attack. The second is specific for error detection and it represents an embedded system in an Internet of Things setting. Both datasets are time series-based and comprise a set of sequences of variable length.
