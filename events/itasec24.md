# Motivation and background

Cyber-attacks have become a severe threat for critical services in several domains, such as healthcare, manufacturing, telecom, energy, transportation, where the impact can be exceedingly high (e.g., in terms of service outages, private data breaches, intellectual property theft). Modern attacks are today very challenging, as they evolved into "Advanced Persistent Threats" (APTs). APT actors are typically cybercriminal or state-sponsored groups, which perform carefully-planned, stealthy attacks that span over a long period of time. A well-known example is the Stuxnet attack, which has been sabotaging Iran's nuclear centrifuges since 2005, and was uncovered in 2010.

Unfortunately, the APT threat landscape is continuously evolving, as attackers develop new tactics and techniques. This trend puts both researchers and organizations at disadvantage, since it is difficult for them to stay up-to-date with emerging APT attacks. Moreover, most organizations are unwilling to share data about attacks they have experienced, because of concerns about disclosing sensitive data. This is a huge opportunity loss, both for the scientific community and for the organizations themselves: scientists are unable to assess new countermeasures on real-world attacks, which hinders scientific progress; organizations are unable to timely update their attack detectors against emerging APT campaigns.

This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers from academia and industry about the use of Generative AI to address these challenges. Recent advances in Generative AI, such as Large Language Models, provides a valuable opportunity to generate new representative datasets of APT attacks, without forcing organizations to disclose their sensitive information.


# Call for talks

The workshop is open to <b>your proposal for a talk</b> at the workshop. To submit a proposal, please send an email to the organizers (see below), with subject <i>"[ITASEC 24] Workshop Talk Proposal"</i>. Please include a title, abstract, and biography of the speaker(s). Please submit your proposal by March 17, 2024.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the relevance and timeliness of the proposed topic, on the potential impact of insights and results on the research community, and on the background and experience of the speakers.

We do not require the submission of papers for the workshop, in order to also include presentations of early-stage ideas and results that are not yet mature for publication. The workshop will aim for lightweight exchange of ideas and networking.
