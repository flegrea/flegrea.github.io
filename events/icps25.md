# About the workshop

The International Workshop on Intelligent Cyber-Physical Security (ICPS) aims to bring together leading researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss advancements, challenges, and solutions in securing cyber-physical systems (CPS).

Cyber-physical systems are fundamental in critical sectors such as healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, energy grids, and smart cities, where any security breach could lead to devastating consequences in both the digital and physical realms. Furthermore, as modern infrastructures increasingly rely on the integration of physical components with complex computational networks, the stakes for ensuring robust, resilient, and intelligent security solutions have never been higher.

With the exponential growth of advanced technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud/Edge Computing, and the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across numerous applications, these interconnected systems offer unprecedented opportunities for efficiency and innovation. However, this growing complexity also expands the attack surface, making these systems highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, ranging from data breaches and malware to more sophisticated attacks on infrastructure integrity, such as ransomware or adversarial AI.

The workshop seeks to address these challenges by fostering discussions on how advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and blockchain can bolster security mechanisms in CPS environments while also considering the new vulnerabilities they might introduce. Moreover, as the boundaries between physical and digital worlds blur, the ability to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real time becomes crucial. This workshop intends to explore the intersection of cybersecurity, digital forensics, anomaly detection, and penetration testing with emerging technologies like AI to create more intelligent and autonomous security solutions.


The workshop is partially supported by the FLEGREA project of the MUR PRIN 2022 program. To find more information about the workshop, visit the webpage at: <a href="https://siti.di.unisa.it/icps2025/" target="_new">https://siti.di.unisa.it/icps2025/</a>
